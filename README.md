# Github-Profile-Search
Welcome to my Github Profile Search project! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Fetch API and Async Await functions. The purpose of this project is to allow users to search for Github profiles and view their information.

To use this project, simply enter a Github username into the search bar and click the search button. The user's profile information will be displayed, including their name, username, bio, number of followers and following, and a list of their repositories.It is a Responsive webiste for mobile users as well.

You can also sort the repositories based on forks,stars and size.

This project is a great example of how to use the Fetch API and Async Await functions to retrieve and display data from an API. Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or improvements you see fit.

Thank you for checking out my Github Profile Search project! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
